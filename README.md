Project 13 
Folder 1 "Calculator" represents the mini calculator project 
Folder 2 "Problem1" solves a problem from HackerRank  
      Problem 1= "Given five positive integers [1, 3, 5, 7, 9], find the minimum and maximum values that can be calculated by summing exactly four of the five integers.
                  Then print the respective minimum and maximum values as a single line of two space-separated long integers.

                    Example

                            The minimum sum is 16 and the maximum sum is 24. The function prints

                              16 24"
Folder 3 "Problem2" solves a problem from LeetCode.
        Problem 2="Given an integer n, return a counter function. 
                    This counter function initially returns n and then returns 1 more than the previous value every subsequent time it is called (n, n + 1, n + 2, etc)."
                    In this, I created an HTML page with buttons for "start", "stop" and "clear" for a better user interface.
